[https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews)


## Overview

This is a project for the Spring 2016 Data Science class at Olin College. We've chosen to work with a dataset of movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes. Our goal was to predict the sentiment of these reviews using various natural language processing tools. A competition based on this dataset was previously hosted on the data science site, Kaggle.
